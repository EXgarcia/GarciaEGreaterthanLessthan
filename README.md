minie challenge #4 "Greater than Less Than"
The console will prompt the user to enter two forms of ints and will compare those values to see if they are greater than or less than.

Review: Marcel R. The program works as intended, and it has play again. It has data validation, it just kicks you out if it's not a string. Other than that very fun program!
